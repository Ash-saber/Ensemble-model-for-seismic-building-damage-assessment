# ATTENTION

The folders 'saint_main' and 'tab_transformer_pytorch' are the direct copies of source codes of  SAINT model and Tab-transformer from https://github.com/lucidrains/tab-transformer-pytorch (Tab-transformer) and https://github.com/somepago/saint (SAINT). Because the authors of the tabular neural networks SAINT model and Tab-transformer used in this article did not provide universal installation paths like xgboost and Tabnet. So I have to add their copies in the subdirectory 'my_function' in order to call them  expediently.

I'm a beginner of Github and I hope it doesn't violate any stipulations here. If I do, commit to me and I will delete the copied folders.
